User input using console.input_alert(\"iHashIt\", \"Description of user input\") and putting it into a variable\n2. Converting user input (which is a string) to a bytearray (I called it bytestring lol) in order to make hashing with user input (string) possible.\n3. Using hashlib for the rest.\n----------\nHUGE SHOUTOUT to Omz::software for creating Pythonista! I\'m a total noob, but at least I created some cool scripts with it, also using its great documentation!\nAlso a big thank you to cclauss for making the code shorter, more effective and compatible with both python 2 and 3!")
